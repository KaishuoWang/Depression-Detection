Me (m23) and my friend let’s call him Kit (m24) met in high school and really didn’t start to hangout until senior year. We had a similar upbringing and problems we were both overweight and both had troubles with Bullying as kids and both came from pretty poor backgrounds. There are some major differences in childhood that we had but that’s not important. The gist is that we both care for each other and are good friend but we handle our problem differently. He took to the booze while I stay away from it due to family history, he is much more open with his illness, while I tend to be quiet about it. He was the brooding kid in high school I was the class joke. So naturally people started to give him attention. This bothered me for a long time and warped my perception of what it means to suffer from depression. I started to feel like maybe nothing was wrong with me and I was being a asshole. But as time went on and we got older he graduated and lost most of his weight, lost his virginity, and he has made more friends and is a very sociable he’s doing well for himself and I’m proud of him. He still post online about his depression and talks extensively about killing himself though. I unfortunately gained more weight, Im not sociable anymore. Don’t get me wrong I can be but I tend not to and he is still my only close friend. I’ve been coming to terms with myself as I want to lose weight, I want to find love, and I want to be more social. I‘m starting to come to terms with my sexuality (I realized I’m Bi I have an attraction to men and women), I realized what I want to do with my life, and I realized I don’t want to be this way anymore and I want to make changes to my life. Well anyways I started making these moves toward my betterment and it’s made me have to make decision for my own sake. I recently made a decision not to move in with Kit. We planned on doing after university and I told him that after I move out of my moms place I wanted to sort of get a fresh start and figure out who I am. I haven’t come out to my friend or family just yet I’m still in the process of accepting myself and I feel that I can’t do that with other people preconceptions of me. I needed a break in the status quo. I’m not ending my friendship with my friend I just need a change. My friend being the great dude he is understood and took it well however everyone of his friend and some of his family did not. They thought I was being selfish, and breaking a promise. They believe that I am abandoning him and that he needed his close friend to help him over come his problems. Even my own mother said what I was doing isn’t fair to him. It made me realize how my feelings didn’t matter. It made me break my diet, it made me contemplate suicide and it made me realize I could never tell these people how I feel because they would think I’m making excuses or jumping on a band wagon with my friend. When people see my friend they see someone who has been suffering from depression since high school and when people see me they see that dumb class clown who didn’t have a care in the world. I hate it here. I don’t want to be here anymore. \\nI want to clarify that I’m not angry or jealous of Kit. I’m glad he lost weight and I’m glad he doing better. I just feel that because he has been open about his problems for years I feel that if I brought up mine his will dwarf my problems. I feel like I’m not allowed to feel the way I feel or that I’m too late and should’ve said something earlier. Sorry for the long post had to get this off my chest.

I never had any friends, everyone always avoided me and treated me like shit. I was too young to notice. \\nThen I was chosen to switch to another class, several weeks into grade 2, losing everything I was familiar with. It turned my world upside down and I expressed that I didn’t like it to teachers and my parents. My parents tried to get me back into my old class but the school refused. My grades then plummeted, which was unusual since no one ever gets bad marks in early grades, since it’s considered so easy. Having that little friends and no one who ever talked to me I became desensitized to others, having no contact with other kids. \\nMy grade 3 teacher was lazy and a terrible teacher, she told my parents I needed adhd meds. When i was on them my attention was worse and I would eat my clothing. I would get into to trouble and break other people’s things, not knowing what I was doing. Other kids would yell at me, telling me to shut up. I would sit by myself and collect rocks. Sometimes a kid named Ethan would talk to me, but only when he had no one else to talk to, and when it was convenient. I wasn’t old enough to see this, all I saw was someone who was interested in me for once. Older kids would bully me, I remember once they spit on a rock and handed it to me. I turned it over and saw the bubbly spit and threw it away. It hit a car and my parents and the older kids were charged 50/50. I found minecraft and started playing it, it was a way to escape my sad life. They took me off the meds after grade 3. \\nIn grade 4, I ended up with the teacher all the kids would complain about, saying she was terrible. I was also with completely new kids who I wasn’t familiar with, and Ethan was in another class. The principle knew most of the kids at the school, and knew I was with a grumpy teacher, and with no one i knew. She did nothing about this. My parents had had enough with the shitty school and terrible staff, so I was moved to a public school. So for grade 4 I changed to a public school, I never had any friends in grade 4 either. I did meet a kid who already had a friend group of 4 and they didn’t want me in it. At this point I was desperate, so I clung to them and followed them around, no matter how many times they told me to go away. I was teased all year, the friend group was bullied since I started being near them. I did that for all of grade 4, still receiving Cs and Ds. \\nIn grade 5, the friend group broke, 1 leaving, and I slipped in, and they tolerated me, too tired to try and get me to leave. I invited them to my birthday party in effort to get them to like me. 1 declined, saying he’d rather see it with his family, after getting the invitation with time and place on it. Then he came with his dad and literally spies on my party, both of them laughing at me and peeking around corners. (Yes I’m serious.) they even booked seats behind the party row, and talked to all the other people I invited, no one talking to the guy who invited them. I also met some batshit crazy girl, who said she liked me and wanted to have sex with me. I was wierded out, and she never kissed me or anything. I told my parents and she got in trouble, we never talked again. She moved on to making out with kindergarteners. \\nFrom grades 4-5 I had decent teachers, but my grade 6 teacher was the worst. He was the kind of teacher to do team captains and let the unpopular kids be last. I was also targeted by a kid named Yousef. He would make fun of me having no friends and me eating by myself. He would shove me on the ground and elbow me in the back of the head. The teacher did nothing. The principal did nothing. Kids would tell me words I didn’t know, (cuz I was dumb and didn’t know shit) they’d tell me to point my middle finger up, and  tell people I was gonna rape, not knowing what any of that means. I would get in trouble for it, and the kids how told me to, wouldn’t. Eventually the friend group of 3 broke up, and I just followed around one of them, who would create imaginary worlds with me, he never really wanted me there, I was just someone to imagine things with, it didn’t matter who it was, but it made me happy all the same. We made imaginary stories, walking up and down the stone path in the school field, making ourselves Pokémon, or wizards, or people with superpowers. I saw him as a friend, he saw me as someone to get story ideas from. And that’s is what we did from grades 6-8. \\nGrade 7, I realized I had to rise above others, there must be something about me that makes people avoid me and hate me. So I studied. I rose from Cs to Bs. I got bullied by a different person, named Hassan, he called my dad a dog, punched and shoved me, insulted me, and ultimately started my way into depression and suicidal thoughts. \\nGrade 8 I rose from Bs to As, I sat by myself, after trying to get friends for so long I gave up. I talked to no one and just did my school work. The guy who would walk with me wanted to escape, even he was bored of me, but I would hassle him till he played more. I graduated elementary, and my depression got worse. I started thinking more serious suicide plans. I spent the summer missing when I was young and innocent. \\nI started Highschool, grade 9, the guy I walked with had finally moved to the popular people, and was glad to be rid of me. I took music and sewing and cooking in hopes of meeting a girl. I ended up just liking the courses and everyone treating me the same. Avoiding me and not giving a shit, not wanting to have a conversation. I tried to see a psychiatrist but talking didn’t help. Neither do the meds. I rescued 5 duck eggs which were abandoned, and I eventually had to give them to a farm since it was illegal. This made me ever more depressed. \\nNow in grade 10 I take more cooking, and music. I’m learning Guitar and Spanish. Still everyone hates me and doesn’t care less if I died. I have thoughts of shooting up the school, or murdering and raping people, as revenge for my terrible lonely life and the poor hand I was dealt. I plan on doing any of these things and then killing my self. Ironically, by train, what I loved so much as an infant will now set me free.',\n","  'labels': ['severe', 'moderate', 'healthy'],\n","  'scores': [0.6105242967605591, 0.26218345761299133, 0.1272922158241272]},\n"," {'sequence': 'Good talk from TED : [removed]',\n","  'labels': ['severe', 'moderate', 'healthy'],\n","  'scores': [0.5136139988899231, 0.3481186628341675, 0.1382673978805542]},\n"," {'sequence': \"My flower grows in the dark. : My flower grows in the dark.\\nIt bends towards my spilling thoughts, sinking eyes.\\nsticking to the walls of my tangled lies.\\nbeautiful if I could ever see it, but I feel it growing.\\nintertwining roots, with my veins, the formidable easer.\\nof my pain. the umbrella to my rain.\\none day I hope it's strong enough, to brave the heat and light\\nbut for now it whispers in my room at night.\",\n","  'labels': ['severe', 'moderate', 'healthy'],\n","  'scores': [0.5866541862487793, 0.3095638155937195, 0.10378200560808182]},\n"," {'sequence': \"I am a failure and I deserve to die : I'm 21F, living far away from my family because of uni.

At least all the homeless would have nicer conditions to sleep on at night.

I can’t recall the name of the place but it’s not important. Gaudy parking lot with what looks like a very well crafted twisting statue of a RV trailer standing up crooked yet steady in the middle of it, behind the locked gate like a silent guardian summoned by rednecks and PBR sacrifices.\\nThe lot was lit up, but not one building had lights on. In fact the whole lot was empty. No cars, no ground security, and no people living in it. Last year this place was standing tall, with regular guests actual people staying in it. Some weekends people would have mini-block parties and performers in this place when the gates were open.\\nNow, it’s a creepy neon ghost town, that plays Sinatra to no one nonstop. I tried to make a video on it but I’m staying incognito here for now. In fact this is a growing concern in my neighborhood. As I was wandering, trying to get lost in the city. Going up Fremont their are several empty lots and locked up motels and single economy lodgings that are just empty, yet on that same corner I see dopesick and desperate people living in tents and wrapped up on the concrete sleeping.\\nAll the money this city makes in tourism, alcohol sales, restuarants, CASINOS, yet I’ve never seen more homeless and people with little to no employment like Las Vegas. I’m went past three blocks of potential halfway houses and possible lodging for these people so they can at least start trying to get off their feet. Nope, their is a nasty ass Siegel Suites where hookers go to die every two blocks here that charges 200 a week though.\\nThe really disturbing and fucked thing to me. Some of these abandoned buildings had paintings of fake doors and windows on them. I tripped out, they were colorful and well done. Lots of yellows and stark reds swathes the outside walls. Hell the painted windows even had sketches of people hanging out of them like friendly neighbors. But the doors weren’t real, the windows weren’t real. The lots were cracked, the weeds in the concrete reclaiming it’s territory from lack of maintenance. The gates high and solid, maintained in better shape than the buildings it was protecting.\\nWith that rolling around in my skull I was in no good shape to be alone (I wasn’t actually alright that night to begin with) and eventually made the hour and a half trek back home.

I’ve done everything but jump on her desk and scream that I’m suicidal and willing to die or ready to start self medicating. I’ve been on every single medication there is, but she won’t adjust the dosage of the medications that do need adjustment.

I’m always ready to break down and my sister constantly berates me. She’s younger than I am, but she has more opportunities than I ever had... yet she makes fun of me because I’ve not gone to college when she knows full well that I cannot afford it and with my luck I’ll never have any scholarship opportunites because there’s always someone better than me.

My day starts with pain, it used to start with coffee, deciding where me and my daughter will go off to what park... Now I can't sip coffe, I have to take 4-5 pills for pain, barely sleep with my husband, I don't go out, ever, anywhere. I  lost 15 kg, I look anorexic.. I used to look so good and feel so bad about myself.. I can't explain to you enough how I regret that. I used to go to gym daily, I loved workouts, I loved the rush.. I loved to cook, I loved junk food, I loved taking pictures, I loved everything, every little trivial thing... I hate my life right now. I have suspicion of endo. I have less cortisol, they call this latent addison. I have hashimoto. I have brain lesions. I have gerb\\nHiatal hernia. Cdiff last year ruined part of my colon. I have adheshions all over my stomach. I am so fucking tired I need to shout it out but I can't. I am tired, I have a two year old beautiful daughter and I can't take her anywhere. I have a husband and I am scared honestly of what is he still doing with me, I am in pain daily... I look like a junkie, since I cannot gain weight easily, food hurts me, literally. And I can't take it anymore. Its 8 am here. My daughter has ear infection, she had high fever and I couldn't sleep for 48 h.. And when I finally got the luxury to sleep I couldn't because pain cought up with me. I am so so so damn tired. I am crying before she wakes up so nobody sees me. I am just so tired.\",\n","  'labels': ['severe', 'moderate', 'healthy'],\n","  'scores': [0.43191802501678467, 0.37199366092681885, 0.19608831405639648]},\n"," {'sequence': \"I can't feel happy for the people I love anymore. : So my friend told me a very good thing that happened to her and, despite having smiled and celebrated, I felt nothing\\n I did what was expected, but I'm empyt.\",\n","  'labels': ['severe', 'moderate', 'healthy'],\n","  'scores': [0.6002025604248047, 0.3139086365699768, 0.08588886260986328]},\n"," {'sequence': 'There’s no point in anything : Since December I feel like I can’t breathe.

So this is an example of someone seeming to be fine with talking to me at first, then their tone shifts to pity.\\n\\\\- in another of one of my first classes there was a guy who would sit next to me in my bio and chem class, since we had the same one and they were back to back. at first he talked to me super friendly and seemed chatty and nice, and he asked for my number. then literally one class to the next, he suddenly seems to really dislike me. he would still sit in the same row as me and talk a little, but he would always make sure that he was at least one seat away from me, so there was an empty one between us. and i thought that\\'s fine, like i figured maybe he\\'s just a person who likes a good amount of space for elbow room or something. but then i realized that he would sit next to the person to the other side of him without a gap, and if in bio there was no room to make that empty seat between us, he\\'d make sure he\\'d move a seat over in chemistry class. idk, this one in particular just really hurt my feelings. he would still talk to me, but his tone shifted, im not sure if it was to a tone of pity or to just trying to not make class awkward. \\n\\\\- another dude from class in college who gave me his number, who at first seemed fine talking to me, then suddenly seemed to really dislike me. \\n\\\\- all my roommates, especially one of them, almost immediately i got the sense she was pissed off or annoyed with me. and it really wasnt all in my head. she cut any conversation i tried to make as short as possible.\\n\\\\- literally everyone i ever met in high school, which is very very few, and i always figured that they didnt like me because i had a reputation for being the weird quiet kid, but in hindsight, some of these people also seemed totally fine with me within the first few interactions, then took the shift to seeming to feel sorry for me or annoyed by me. \\nclearly there\\'s a pattern here, but the problem is i honestly dont know what im doing wrong. i know plenty of reasons why someone SHOULD hate me, but within the first few surface level interactions i think i cover up my horrible qualities pretty well, so i dont understand how come their tone seems to shift so drastically with me. it\\'s not that i smell, im not strikingly ugly, i dont think, and i pretty much always stick to \"safe\" uncontroversial subjects when i talk to people. i dont know, and i doubt anyone else really can from this explanation either, so what i was wondering is, has anyone ever just felt a \"bad aura\" from someone? like for no particular reason, you just cant help but really dislike them? Im wondering if maybe, despite how hard i try to hide them, my bad qualities somehow manage to seep through into my conversations still, so i just give off \"negative energy\" that people cant really help but dislike, even if there isnt a reason that they can place their finger on. \\n if anyone somehow understands this or has some sort of advice, it\\'s really appreciated.',\n","  'labels': ['moderate', 'severe', 'healthy'],\n","  'scores': [0.4515676498413086, 0.3101561665534973, 0.23827624320983887]},\n"," {'sequence': \"How does one go about enjoying things and being entertained? : Video games are boring to me.

I\\'ve had the former all my life. I was diagnosed with the latter last year, but have probably had it for far longer. It only began to take over my life after I was raped in 2018. I have had to be sent to a mental hospital for med adjustments and suicide prevention on multiple occasions over the last 5 years. Until about 12 hours ago, I had been withdrawing from my antidepressants and hormone treatments. I had started withdrawing about 3 days prior. I spent those 3 days being shuffled around and gatekept by everyone with the authority to help me. Meanwhile, withdrawals and brain zaps were fracturing my brain and causing me to howl like an ape over the phone to my own mother. \\nI was denied a refill of my antidepressants and hormone medication about a week and a half ago, around Valentine\\'s Day. None of my medications realistically require regular checkups, but from what I understand this is legally required for all controlled substances, be they antidepressants or Adderall. So I told the pharmacy OK, order a new script. They told me no, talk to my doctor, they probably want to check on me before giving me a refill. Despite everyone\\'s insistence that this happens regularly, I have never needed a checkup for antidepressants. I have not been examined for hormone treatments since 2018. They\\'ve just given me the fucking meds. In reality, unbeknownst to me, the practice the pharmacy was ordering these ghost meds from, which was the wrong practice and *not* my primary care, had silently closed their doors. No word of this at all to me. I wasn\\'t informed of this until calling them today, over a week later. Meanwhile, I attempted to call my primary care, the real people writing my real prescriptions. The separate, now-closed practice wrote me a prescription once as a one-off thing, and that\\'s why they were in the pharmacy\\'s records at all. The latter practice was what my pharmacy requested my new prescription from. However, my primary care\\'s voice menu, separate from the other, closed practice, was broken and hung up the call before I could even speak to anybody. In effect, they were hanging up on me. So I went back to my pharmacy and got a 3-day prescription to hold me over until I could get an appointment. The average psych schedules first-time appointments at least a week out, if you\\'re lucky. I went through those meds in the blink of an eye. When I went back for another, I was informed that I could be given only one 3-day prescription regardless of how long I waited. \"Talk to your doctor.\" I told them I couldn\\'t, because they were hanging up on me. There was no way they believed me. They just repeated themselves then sent me home without meds. This was around Friday, the 21st of February. I spent from then until Monday unable to contact anyone, and withdrawing from my meds. The pharmacy was just totally down to let me do that, I guess. Meanwhile, the original request they had made to the closed practice was just floating in the ether, being faxed to no one. At this point, the denial was four-fold: my primary care was giving me the cold shoulder, the pharmacy was refusing my meds, the practice I called for backup just up and vanished, and my new insurance hadn\\'t been updated in pharmacy records yet. No one was explaining to me why now, of all times, my meds were being taken away. As an extra layer, my family had changed insurance in 2020, so no prescriptions written could even be paid for until I eventually had that updated. None of this was communicated directly to me. I toughed it out and spent Friday-Monday withdrawing from all of my meds, then went back to the pharmacy on Monday to explain my situation. I was told again to talk to my doctor. I explained that I couldn\\'t, because they were hanging up the phone on me. The pharmacy insisted they could not help me. I wasn\\'t sure what else to do at this point, so I had my best friend take me to urgent care that night for emergency Rx. Withdrawals and brain zaps were making it hard to walk and talk, so my body was only letting me sleep from early morning to late afternoon, and urgent care was the only place that was open besides the literal hospital. Despite this, urgent care insisted that they were unable to write prescriptions for antidepressants, and redirected me to the ER. So my friend drove me to the ER. While we were in line, we got a front row seat to about 8 cops tackling and arresting a rowdy kid in a wheelchair. After about an hour in the lobby, I was called to the back. I was then made to wait in an ER bed for about 3 hours. I got a nap out of the whole thing, at least, as well as a request for 30 days of meds from an RN. Hell yeah! All I had to do was pee in a cup, because Lord knows I coulda been doping on that desvenlafaxine! That was worth me giving them an unmarked, untraceable bottle of my pee that they now just kinda have My mother insisted to me, whilst I was losing my shit over the phone, that this was the fault of the opioid crisis, and not that of the moronic bureaucrats that created it. I love my mama, but she lives in this weird quantum state where she is simultaneously saving my life and lecturing me about why all of my feelings are wrong. I dunno. Mothers. So long story short, I got to go home from the ER with an alleged prescription in my name for 30 days of meds. Great. I went the next day, Tuesday, to my pharmacy to pick it up. I was told that the original request was still pending and to talk to my doctor. It was only *then* that I was informed that the lost request was going to the closed practice, and it was only then that I called the now-closed practice as backup to discover that they were even closed at all. I went back to the ER to see what the deal was and ask for a paper copy of my prescription, on authority from my mom, who is very experienced with bureaucracy. After another 20 minutes in line, I got to ask for a paper copy. After another few minutes in the lobby, an RN pulled me aside and found the log of the prescription from Sunday night. I wasn\\'t permitted to leave with a paper request, so the guy called the pharmacy I had just left. The pharmacist there found a prescription under my current legal name and the meds were apparently waiting for me this whole time. That wasn\\'t what I was told! So I went back to the pharmacy one last time, asking what the deal was. It was then that I had found out that the pharmacy had not yet updated my last name, because my old last name wasn\\'t updated for whatever reason on my insurance card from 2019. Mind you, I had my new insurance card in my wallet with my current full name on it, and I didn\\'t know where or with whom to udpate this information, so requests were being made by like 5 different people under 5 different names for the same 3 meds. None of these requests have gone through yet. This much was all figured out between myself, my mother, and pharmacy staff over about an hour long conversation. It was only then that I had my name and insurance properly updated for both the hospital and the pharmacy, and it was only then that insurance would pay for the prescription from the ER, which they could now finally see. Once that was all said and done, I still had to pay 20% on my parents\\' HSA card. I tore open the packaging in front of the lady as quickly as my shaky hands would allow and gobbled the pills down right there. And I ate ice cream cause I fucking earned it.\\nI asked my mom why it took this much. She told me \"give it a few days to figure it out\". I could tell she was trying to tell me, diplomatically, that I\\'ll realize in time that this was my fault. This is what happens when I try to have a backbone about fucking anything. What was the point to going to all this therapy to improve my self-esteem if it\\'s so fucking scandalous to everyone around me the moment I do? Why am I the asshole for wanting meds as soon as I need them? It\\'s not personal, I just want my brain to fucking work. Sure, hindsight\\'s 20/20 and if I could navigate bureaucracy flawlessly, then yeah, maybe I could\\'ve had meds before I ran out. But I didn\\'t because I\\'m 23 and no one taught me this shit. Why is that my fault and why do I have to suffer for it? I\\'m not even sad anymore I\\'m just fucking furious that this is what I have to deal with.

I don\\'t expect any response or anything. I just need a place to write down my feelings and maybe just maybe I could get a little bit of hope. I have never really told anyone the full story since, since I have some trust issues. \\nAs far as I could remember, I never really had a happy childhood. I basically grew up with my grandparents (mom side), while my mom was working 3 jobs to just keep us fed and sending most of the money to my dad. And my dad was never around, since he lived in a different country at the time.  I don\\'t think I even have any memories of him until I was 9, when I finally got to lived with him. That was mostly due to the fact that my grandparents from my dad\\'s side didn\\'t want us immigrant there. So when my mom and I finally got the chance to move in with my dad and his parents, it finally felt like a family. But the thing is, my grandparents from my dad\\'s side often verbally abuse my mom and I when my dad isn\\'t around. My mom always took the abuse hoping that it would never reach to me, and while my dad had his anger problems, she always protected me from any actual danger. But I always knew, but there was nothing I can do. I felt hopeless, but I thought at least I finally have someone to call dad. I knew he loved us, especially me, but he actions were a bit violent at the same time. My mom fear the worst if she were to go to work, and my dad were to take his anger out on me, so she left me in the care of my grandparents ( dad\\'s side). Between a broken family or an abusive one, I rather have the broken family. Because it seemed like my grandparents were so tired of us, they frame my mom for abuse. And I remember waiting for her that night. It was later than ever. I was scared, my mom was gone, and I started crying uncontrollably. I beg my dad multiple times to to call my uncle for help, and he finally gave in. My uncle hired a lawyer got establish an alibi, and my mom was freed. That was the moment, my mom knew there was no where safe for her and I. So she took me and ran in the middle of the night, using whatever little money she had to trade for a flight ticket to anywhere. And that was the last memory I had of my dad. That 6 months wasn\\'t much, but at least he was there.    \\nWhen I arrived to the new location, my mom had very little income. She was working hard to get herself a job, and start fresh. With little to no money, there were days were all we could afford was cup of rice for the day. And the day my mom finally found a job, we celebrate with a can fish with rice. That was one of the happier meal I shared with her. She continue to work 3 jobs just to provide for us. And then she met a man. I was 12 at the time, and when he started to sexually abuse me, I did everything stay away from him. I intentionally get extra weights, try to be around my mom( when she wasn\\'t at work) as often as I could when he was around, and when he would try to touch me while I\\'m asleep, I would try to block with my stuff animals. I was terrified to be at home. I couldn\\'t tell my mom since, it seems like for once she was happy, and stable. I didn\\'t want to ruined that for her, and so I kept everything to myself. Slowly I found myself to be more and more suicidal. But my religion told me that its a sin to kill myself, and so I kept on breathing. Numb, looking for any kind of love or attention. I was isolated without a family or anyone to trust. That lesson was reinforce when I finally made some real friends during those years, or so I though. I thought if we were close enough I could share what was going on in my life. It was just the two of us, I thought I could really call her my best friend (lets call her Jess). And then she met a new friend (lets call her Erica), and our little circle got just a little bigger. We had some really good times. They were my escape from home, but slow I felt that Jess and Erica were excluding me on their hang outs. Jess would began to tease me endlessly about my weight and Erica just join in on the \"fun\" ( when I was intentionally gaining for self protection). At one point, they would start to wearing matching clothes for parties and event. When I asked them if they had gotten me matching clothes too, and they told me off. I knew they no longer wanted me at their circle. At that point, I had completely given up on them. I\\'d purposely chose a different high school and maybe a new group of friends, and start fresh. \\nFast forward 10 years. I finally feel mature enough to meet with my dad. I wanted to tell him how much I have grown. And I just wanted to know how he was doing. I was planning on buying the plane ticket the weekend during my break. And the two days before that, I received a phone call. I was told that he had pass away. I had finally gotten the courage to go and see him, but I was already too late. I just wanted to tell him that, I missed him. And that I loved him. And that I was doing okay, and I do well in school, and even thought he wasn\\'t part of most of my life, I have always remember him. I was ready. Ready to meet him. Ready to see him, to see how he was doing. And now the last memory of him was the one where he was laying in the coffin. Why is it that I try so hard to reach out, but results is always so disappointing? Again and again, I am reminded that there is no point in having hope. Why do I even bother trying anymore. I\\'m just so tired. I just want it to be over already. If I don\\'t wake up tomorrow, what is there to lose anyways. At least the pain, the disappointment, the loneliness can finally stop.

I\\'m worried about being judged, I\\'m afraid they simply won\\'t care, I\\'m afraid they\\'ll think I\\'m weak, and I\\'m afraid somebody will just say that I\\'m \"feeling down\" or \"have the blues\" or that they\\'ve been \"sad too.\" Depression is none of those. Depression is that feeling, among many others being carried with you every moment of every day. My depression is even accompanied by horrible anxiety and ADHD, making things even worse for me to handle. And furthermore, if I DID tell somebody how I truly felt, I\\'m worried I would ruin their day with my sad emotions, or that they would just get sick of listening and zone out.

I've had depression for a while; as far as i can remember, I've had it during high school. I was able to graduate, and I was able to get the STAR Scholarship, but I feel like I dug myself into my own grave. Most of the time, if not all of the time, I feel more dead than alive,  I have no energy or strength, waking up is a chore, I'm easily distracted and lose focus too quickly, very few things make me happy, I have next to no support, and my college work has taken a big hit. Last semester, I stopped doing work near the end; this semester, I haven't done any work at all. And the worst part? My family doesn't know. My mom wants me to do well, and i feel incapable of saying no, so i went to college, and I lie to her and the rest of my family about doing my homework. I know for a fact she's gonna find out soon. I was lying to myself, too, trying to convince myself that everything's under control, but now, I desperately need help. I used to see a therapist starting at high school, but she just went on maternity leave lately, and I'm having trouble trying to get into touch with another therapist. For some reason, I've been recently having these passive thoughts about suicide; I'm not planning it, but the thought's been roaming around in my head. I don't have the courage to end my life, but anything would be better than this. I haven't seen my doctor in a while, maybe going there might help. I've been spending my time watching stuff online, playing video games, lurking Reddit, and if I'm feeling in the mood, drawing, but I haven't drawn for myself for a while.

Accepting your reality and your emotions and not needing to hold on to every little thing that might make your day the tiniest bit more bearable or positive. It's okay if your friend's too busy to talk, it's okay if you run out of your drug of choice. It's okay that the only dim flicker of light in the darkness, the only thing that made you crack a smile, isn't there anymore. Don't feel bad for going through it alone. This is sometimes necessary. \\nAll I hear all over social media is that you're not alone, you're loved, you're wanted. What if this is not the case? Don't feel sorry for yourself if this is not the case. You need to be okay with not being okay by yourself. Because every day you go through it alone, you're giving yourself the chance to be your own support system. Forgive yourself. As long as you're alive, you objectively have a chance to heal. Take that chance. Sure, reach out for help but also, attempt to help yourself when others can't be there. You don't know if you can do it alone. You might not be able to. But you're the only one that has full responsibility over that.  EVERYONE is living their own life, worrying primarily about themselves and the ones that don't, are sacrificing themselves to do that. Which is okay for parents but not always otherwise and shouldn't be encouraged. You need a degree of selfishness to maintain your mental health. \\nI hope this doesn't come across as encouraging people not to get help. I just have to point out that not everyone has the means to reach out to people and to be loved by others. No one should derive their self-worth from that. YOU have to love yourself and that takes a shit load of suffering to do correctly. But in the end, it's always worth it. Because the freedom you feel from truly loving yourself and not needing someone to love you or give you attention, is incomparable to anything else.

I don\\'t really understand what\\'s going on with me but I think I\\'m not only severely depressed but fighting with anxiety and stress on levels that are seriously effecting my health and I\\'m terrified.\\nLast night I tried smoking some weed thinking it would help change my mood or something. To try and make me feel anything else really than my general uninterest in things or severe loneliness. To be completely honest with you, if you were to tell me I might have a drug problem or maybe a history of substance abuse you\\'d be about half right. I don\\'t really do drugs as often as I used to. When I was in high school I remember a time where I smoked like maybe 5-10 joints a day and bought ounces every other few days or so. These days I smoke maybe about .2 grams a month if even that. Sometimes I go entire months without smoking even once. A lot of it is because I can\\'t spare the funds to do it and I never really felt like it was something I depended on. Back in high school I was extremely stressed out and did it recreationally a little too much but nowadays I lack the friends to even do it with and every time I do it\\'s by myself at night.\\n*The reason I\\'m telling you this is because this serves more as a preface to the story of what happened to me these past couple of days. I\\'ve never in my life felt more scared for my life than what happened the last two times I smoked.. so here it goes.*\\n# The Night I Almost Died\\nIt was a night like any other. I was feeling down and lonely and the usual really. I decided I was gonna smoke a very insignificant amount, like maybe 2-4 pulls and clip the blunt because I didn\\'t want to get too high. After I finished doing so I started working on my PC because I was trying to install mac on a VM because I needed to use the OS for something in relation to my iphones jailbreak. I started finding myself unable to focus on what I was doing even though I was reading the instructions out in my head and even out loud at some point because I noticed a second set of thoughts racing through my head that made it really hard to focus.\\nAnd then it happened. Suddenly this intense and spontaneous rush of negative thoughts completely overwhelmed my brain. I felt like I was being overloaded and began experiencing a rapid change in my heart rate as well as beat skipping and even pulsating physical pains as my heart continued to accelerate. I felt a rush of adrenaline as thoughts like \"Imagine if you died.\" or \"You should just kill yourself\" began to rapidly fill my head. I started feeling a shortness of breath, in fact I felt like any deep breath I would tried to take would lead to my heart exploding. I literally felt like at any second I was going to have a heart attack. I constantly held my hand to my chest and sometimes stood there in shock because I thought it happened, I thought my heart stopped or something or was going to. My first instinct was to try my best to calm down and drown out the negativity. I began talking to myself out loud trying to tell myself things like reasons I should live and that is not actually how I feel and I should relax. I told myself things like I have a family, and a loving mother who would be really sad if I were gone. I tried everything I could to help myself realize that these negative thoughts filling my head were not how I truly felt.\\nSometimes it worked. I began to breathe slowly and my heart rate would slow and it temporarily subsided. I then sat down and tried continuing to work to distract myself from the experience but eventually it just came back and even worse. I literally jumped out of my seat holding back the urge to scream or run out of my room and tell someone I feel like I\\'m dying. My heart was beating so fast It scared me to try and even feel it because i felt like even a mere touch to my chest was going to stop my heart. \\nThings began getting really weird. I felt like I was possessed. For some reason I just started envisioning ways to kill myself, like a scene playing in my head of me literally walking to the kitchen and grabbing a knife and doing who knows what with it. At one point I\\'m pretty sure I heard whispers or something. My mind was just playing tricks with me and I felt like I was arguing with another version of myself.\\nIt got to a point where I had to text or call someone. I ended up texting my brother in law in an attempt to calm myself down by letting him know how I\\'ve been generally feeling. I didn\\'t want to tell him the exact situation I was in because I don\\'t want to worry anyone as I still felt strong enough to overcome the situation because only a few nights before, the same thing happened.\\nAfter texting with him for a bit I began to calm down more and I also downloaded an app on my phone to help monitor my heart rate and try more breathing exercises to calm down. After I was finally over the high I started realizing that my heart rate does tend to rise pretty quickly even when I\\'m just resting. I also felt like these past few months, due to how inactive I am generally or how unhealthy I eat that these may be heart palpitations or something similar. I\\'m no doctor, but these past few weeks my chest and my heart especially have been making me feel generally uncomfortable. Even as I type this now I felt a weird tightness near the left side of my chest that I can\\'t help but periodically touch with my palm to check on my heart rate. \\nAfter this experience I\\'ve finally made a personal decision that I fully intend to keep. I used to be the kind of guy who didn\\'t mind drinking or doing LSD or smoking weed and even thought about trying DMT soon. But now I really don\\'t think I have any intention to use or especially abuse substances anymore because I am genuinely concerned for my health and I just really don\\'t want to die. I may not feel happy all the time. I may not be as social or even as healthy as I used to but I\\'m not suicidal, or at least the real me, not the drugged up me, isn\\'t. \\n*I genuinely want to get help but I\\'m having a hard time doing so. The last time I looked up my health insurance information to find a psychiatrist or therapist or something like that in my area that would accept my health insurance all I ever seem to get is the run around with voice machines that tell me to call other voice machines and never get anyone on the line that I can get to make an actual appointment with. It got to a point where I just gave up and thought I could figure things out on my own and even though I did for a while I feel like I can\\'t afford to take that risk anymore.* \\n*I am really desperately trying to find a doctor in the NYC area, preferably Manhattan that will take Empire Bluecross Blueshield insurance. I\\'m sorry if I may be putting too many personal info here but I would just really like some kind of assistance in getting help. I have absolutely no problem making the calls I need and physically going to the locations I need to go but I could just use some direction.* \\n*I really need things to change. I can\\'t stand the thought of seeing my mother cry again from being concerned about my well being. In fact I\\'m tearing up now just even thinking about it. I can\\'t let this anxiety or depression or bi polar or what ever any of this is take control of my life.*\\n*I just want to get better.*',\n","  'labels': ['severe', 'moderate', 'healthy'],\n","  'scores': [0.7688050270080566, 0.16092745959758759, 0.07026747614145279]},\n"," {'sequence': \"Happiness : I spend most of my days thinking of happiness, not my happiness, but my lack of it.

His \"excuses\" as to why he didn\\'t visit was that he couldn\\'t leave the bathroom all weekend, which means he didn\\'t take his meds correctly which he does often and couldn\\'t leave because he was constantly using the bathroom. \\\\*note I had a private bathroom he could use as needed. \\\\* That was his excuse, there were rest-stops on the way, there was ways to get to the hospital. He decided that I was not worth enough to do so.   \\nThat started the depressive episode, and it is still getting worse daily. After surgery, I was unable to go to therapy for at least a week, because healing, then it turned into \"I am demanding you make both of our appointments because I don\\'t want to do it\". we see different therapists, he\\'s going bi-weekly I go weekly they rarely have the same days. I had struggled to get to the office via phone, and when I did I said fuck this I\\'ll make my own he\\'s a grown man he can do his own. I can\\'t see my therapist until the 9th. It will be nearly a month since I last saw her. And each day makes it worse. I finally got thru the 2nd portion of the liquid diet, now I\\'m on pureed, and its still so hard. Because I am the one trying to go by the book on what I can safely eat. Is it on the pureed allowed food list? no? then no you can\\'t eat it. \"yes? okay good how to make it taste good without adding extra shit. And I\\'m still doing it alone, Dad swore he\\'d support me and help me, and what does he do? Bring more and more fast food in, junk food and ice cream I cannot touch \\\\* I can have sugar free popsicles. That\\'s about it, same with sugar-free jello/pudding\\\\* but he brings in things like mega fries, or wings, or Chinese, stuff I LOVE but I cannot touch now, and maybe ever. Or he cooks a huge batch of chili/taco meat and again, its to \"solid\" for me, that\\'s soft food stage, I got 2wks before that\\'s allowed. He\\'s been told, he just doesn\\'t care.   \\nSo each day it\\'s making harder to keep to the diet. I try to ask for help and I\\'m shot down, I get told \"no that\\'s not allowed\" but it is in the book I was given on the stage given! I am trying so hard to keep to the diet, to ignore my cravings while actually still eating. I get sick if I don\\'t eat, if I eat, I get sick. I can\\'t drink anything for an hour after I eat. And I can\\'t seem to get any support, from anyone except a few friends. And that hurts. I\\'ve been pushing my self harder than I should because if I wait for dad, I\\'d never get to the store and then I\\'m rushed because he wants to leave. I can\\'t do that when I need to LOOK AT STUFF and check labels. This surgery isn\\'t a quick fix, I\\'m a little over 2wks post-op and I\\'m struggling. And I feel so alone. I see the scale going down, and it barely makes me happy. I have started not to feel anything. And that scares me, I\\'m falling into old habits which isn\\'t good, \\\\*thankfully not food-related\\\\* but that\\'s backtracking into a person I don\\'t want to be.

Right now in a sense, I\\'m chained to the house, driving takes to much out of me, going to the store tires me out. I just wanna be happy. and I know therapy will help because I got the news I can move after 8wks \\\\*I cannot afford it, I\\'m living off my tax refund right now it\\'s that bad\\\\* but it\\'s so hard to be happy anymore...Because limited to nothing makes me happy anymore....  \\nI just feel so damn alone anymore and I don\\'t know what to do.',\n","  'labels': ['healthy', 'moderate', 'severe'],\n","  'scores': [0.5420043468475342, 0.24290984869003296, 0.21508581936359406]},\n"," {'sequence': 'Started my first day at work.

I’ve never been the slightest bit suicidal or had thoughts about that kinda thing. My childhood and early teenage years were pretty conventional, humble but I can look back and definitely say I enjoyed that period of my life. I’ve always been told by a lot of different people that I’m really funny and have quick wits and I’m fun to be around but at the same time was always kind of a loose cannon.

My main issue is that I really don’t feel any positive feelings anymore if that makes any sense. I feel apathetic to almost everything around me. Things I used to do/experience don’t give any sort of pleasure. The music I listen to would physically give me goosebumps and put me in a trance now don’t get that nearly as much, the sports I watch don’t put me on edge at all anymore, when people compliment me or when good things happen to me I don’t get endorphins or any euphoria. Intimate contact/ sex doesn’t do as much for me. There are times I can actually tell that I feel inadequate. Whenever I’m in public or even around more than a handful of friends, I get flooded with anxiety. I feel petrified in my own skin for some bizarre, awful reason. I forget to smile, I can’t come up with relevant/funny things to say, I always feel like the secondary option/sidekick to the people I’m with.

I want to die. : I\\'m writing this sitting in the smoking area, while drunk people happily dance a few feet away to a live band. I\\'ve experienced things this past week that I didnt think I ever would. My kids are having the time of their lives. I should be happy.\\nDepression. A word that I\\'ve struggled with for most of my life. \"I don\\'t suffer from that. I\\'m not crazy.\" I\\'ve never been able to admit to myself that I suffer from mental illness. Until now.\\nI\\'m pushing 40. I\\'m married with two beautiful children. I have an okay job that I\\'ve been at for 14 years and I\\'m a homeowner. I should be happy.\\nI struggle with anger. The smallest things set me off. Driving brings out rage. Something doesn\\'t go right. Rage. Things get thrown, my basement walls have the battle scars of my fists. After every explosion, I come back to earth with feelings of shame and remorse. There\\'s no physical abuse in my house, but my kids are afraid of me.\\nGrowing up, dad was a drunk. A mean drunk. Not so much physically abusive, but when he was drunk, he\\'d spit his venom at my mom, sister and I. He ended up losing his job (for drinking) and my parents split. From the time I was 12 my mom would work up to three jobs at a time. I spent a lot of time alone when I was a teenager. My sister was much older and moved out at 17. I didnt have too many friends through high school and was, more or less, a loser. I learned to cook for myself at a young age and was alone while mom was at work in the afternoons and nights.\\nI was molested by an older boy when I was 5 or 6. I can\\'t remember most of the details, but I know it happened. More than once.\\nSelf loathing. I hate myself. I mean, I fucking hate myself. I\\'ve struggled with weight for most of my life. Up and down. I have man boobs. I remember being made fun of as a child for it. I was with my wife for nearly two years before she saw me without a shirt on. We had a child before she saw me without a shirt on. I love swimming. I can count on one hand the amount of times I\\'ve swam since I was 13. I see myself in the mirror and I wish for death. Constantly. I\\'m disgusted by my being. \\nThoughts in my head: \"You\\'re garbage. You\\'re a piece of shit. You\\'re disgusting. You\\'re a fat waste of space.\" You get the idea.\\nI have very high levels of stress and anxiety. All the time. I\\'m worried about everything and I mean everything. \\nI\\'ve managed pretty well for most of my life. Keeping things in check. Keeping things together whilst being plagued by worry, anxiety, depression and anger. I rarely drink. As of late I\\'ve been using (legal) marijuana as a coping mechanism. \\nI was really anxious about this trip that I\\'m on. Swimming. Fuck. This whole episode started at the beginning of January when I started thinking about this trip. I hit rock bottom with depression and suicidal ideation. I didnt talk to anyone in my family for days. I even started making exit plans. One of my family members helped me along and I was starting to feel better. I even went to my doctor and had a couple meetings with the office counselor. (This was extremely hard for me to do)\\nMe: I\\'m a disgusting man and I hate myself\\nCounselor: I know lots of people that are unhappy with their bodies. \\nWell shit. That fixes everything. These meetings were a colossal waste of time.\\nSince January I\\'ve had good and bad days. The bad outnumbering the good by a large margin. I have never in my life felt so out of control as I have these past couple of months. I feel like everything is unravelling. \\nMy wife. I can\\'t talk to her. It feels like she doesn\\'t want to hear it. She doesn\\'t want to listen. She\\'s emotionally distant. No hugs or kisses in my marriage. Hugging her is awkward. Yeah you read that right. Hugging and kissing my fucking wife is awkward. She\\'s amazing with our children, like a 10/10 mom. Myself,  I feel like I have a roommate. I don\\'t feel loved and it hurts so bad. I\\'ve tried talking to her about it many times but nothing changes. I see other married couples holding hands, hugging and kissing and it rips me to shreds. \\nI\\'ve never been medicated. I\\'ve never been properly diagnosed. And I\\'ve never really talked about it. As I mentioned earlier, I\\'ve been pretty good at holding things together. I just can\\'t do it anymore.\\nStanding on the deck, I look down into the black waters and picture myself jumping in to my death. Just climb over the railing and after a few minutes, I\\'ll be like Sonic the Hedgehog in the water levels. Falling into the abyss. Sitting in the room, I think about tying my belt around my neck and closing it in the top of the bathroom door. I haven\\'t attempted suicide before but that doesn\\'t stop me from thinking about it all the time. Almost anything I see, I think about how I can use it to kill myself. I\\'m terrified of these dark thoughts.\\nMy oldest child knows that something\\'s not right. He\\'s overheard conversations I\\'ve had with my wife and he\\'s been really upset. Its reminding me about how I felt when I was his age. I feel powerless to stop it. I get so down on myself and say horrible things about myself and I see how it hurts him and its killing me to see him cry. I love him so much and I\\'m breaking him and I want to die even more when I think about it.\\nI think my kids are the only reason I\\'m still here (certainly isn\\'t my wife).\\nI\\'m tired.

It's how people respond to me now that I'm lost and depressed as opposed to vibrant and well put together.\\nI have a high education and have been working for years in my field. It has always given me a sense of stability to have my wits acknowledged and to able to connect to people easily and find the good in things. I lived in a fancy apartment in a very good neighbourhood. If I had to make a phone call to someone about something back then, it'd be with enthusiasm and about some minor detail, like arranging a birthday party or getting a vaccine for my kid etc. Every communication that I had with people was pleasant or non dramatic. I didn't have a reason to contact anyone to solve my problems. \\nWell, the relationship fell apart. I'm the one who had to move out. I never found a place to rent or buy after that. It's been 5 years now. I've been renting many places for short periods, as this has been all I've able to find. My mental health has been going downwards for every year that has passed me by, without a place to call my own. I've had to call everyone and everything to fix my problems ever since. It's been one thing after the other, because of the domino effect. I *can't* find a place, so that adds major stress, I have to store all my stuff with family and with storage services, find a place to keep my address, figure out how to deal with that in conjuction to the fact that I have a kid with my ex and I can't just move my address far away without getting into trouble over it. I'm just floating around out here, like a balloon. I wonder when I'll completely float away. Life took a turn and *everything* changed. It's a nightmare and I'm performing miracles everyday just to make it into the next day, but the problems keep piling up and the people, the way they respond to me now.. \\nI've found that *everybody* in my social circle is either a stranger now or apathetic towards my situation. I have no adults to lean on and everybody puts this extra distance or contempt towards me. I've had no help. I've really discovered society as a cold place that has just laughed in my face when I needed it the most. I feel used by society and thrown away like garbage. Every time that I've had to explain my ordeal to the municipality office or a doctor etc., they've talked to me like I'm stupid after learning that I'm stressed and depressed. It somehow takes away my credibility as a person that I've become depressed. Everyone speaks to me in a baby voice and I just almost reject the world for what it has become to me.

Thousands of dollars in debt and yet I still want to drop out but I know that it’s not an option. I have to pretend like I’m not suicidal but for what? It doesn’t feel worth it but neither does dropping out and wasting all this time and money with no paper to show for it. If those are my two options, I feel like I’m left to just kill myself because I can’t win either way. I just want to escape and abandon my current life completely. Leave all of life’s responsibilities behind. The pressures of society are too much for me to handle but it’s not a choice.

I'm from Eastern Kentucky (very southern) and attend(ed) the university of Kentucky. Finally, I'm an atheistic gay guy in a long-term relationship that includes 3 years of living together as roommates.\\nNow, I want to say that nothing above is really relevant. I've had crippling depression since 16, am proud of my heritage, and I have a supportive family, i.e. I'm treated as a son, not necessarily a gay son or an atheist son-- we have mutual respect for our differences.\\nWhat is relevant is that I don't know how I'm going to survive life. I am medicated and see a psychiatrist at least monthly.\\nI started treatment fall 2018, when I withdrew from college in order to get medications sorted/get back on track. Everything seemed to be okay, I did well last semester, and now I've had to withdraw again. I'm right back where I was a year ago. I love my program of study and my school. I'm confident that it is not the problem. At most the stress exasterbates the problem.\\nThat being said, last week I went to a professor for help/asking for leniency to get caught up(I have a letter of accommodation and my school's disability resource center allows me to have attendance flexibility/due date flexibility). The professor refused. Okay, not a big deal, really. The issue is that he closed the door and lectured me for at least half an hour about how everybody goes through problems, about how his nephew failed out of college causing him to be depressed, and generally just underminding what a disability is. I attempted to leave twice because he brought me to tears with the berating, which also caused me to get angry. He kept telling me to sit back down. I'm a polite person, so I just didn't respond until he lectured out, then I left. He insulted my intelligence several times. To say he has a mightier than thou complex is an understatement, as I am aware and was aware that he is an intelligent individual. There was never a question. However, he knew exactly what my life problems and internal situations were, apparently. He interrupted me when he asked a question. He assumed me to be someone I'm not from the ground up, and he wouldn't let me say who I am. Apparently, I am a dumb country-boy who misses home and forsakes my responsibilities. \\nI'm aware I can get him into trouble, and etc. However, I don't want to be in a class with somebody like that, so I just dropped the course. I have a full-ride scholarship, but I've officially withdrawn from the university and basically I have thrown it away. My GPA isn't in the shitter because I've been able to withdraw 3 times now. I could probably go back but it's a bad idea and I know it.\\nThe thing is, that's not an uncommon reaction by professors, I've noticed. There are some who are absolutely amazing, and we usually set up a plan at the beginning of the semester, and there is no problem. The rest just want me to email them if anything is up. I do, then they tell me I need an excuse(rules say I don't), that they don't approve of the behavior, or outright ignore me. I've never asked for anything grandiose. It's at most extensions.\\nAfter I got out of the office with that professor, I had one of the worst breakdowns of my life. I sat in my car crying for about an hour, then pulled myself together enough to drive 5 minutes home, then isolated myself and continued wallowing. I'm not sure if it was some sort of manic decision or what, but I then decided to completely withdraw, not just his class.\\nI'm thinking I'm going to take time off again. I'm not sure it will end any differently, but I've decided to go to school a little closer to home- which entails probable loans, moving, and throwing away everything from before. The reason I'm choosing the school is purely logical--price and programs available. It at most shaves 30 minutes off a 3 hour drive, so I'm not sure that my impression that it's closer to home is even true, really. \\nMy internal dialogue says this is going to end the same way, and that I should just drive off a cliff, or whatever. I just don't know if I can trust my decision because I'm at the bottom again, and I know I make awful decisions while depressed. I just let life go and cease caring, which later creates a vicious cycle in which my previous decisions cause me to constantly try fixing everything, which is exhausting and I become depressed, rinse and repeat.\\nIs it a manic decision to completely uproot and move? I recently spent close to 5k in a manic decision, so I have no idea. I feel like my guiding compass is blacked out, somehow.\\nI really don't think school is an issue academically, but the culture may just be wrong for me. I don't know. But I've been someone with major depressive disorder since 16, so I KNOW my episodes don't always have a cause or source. It just happens. The best I can usually do is mitigate and stop it from going too far.\\nI am thinking I'm probably bipolar, but that's not an issue I want to think about right now. I have an appointment, and I'm sure the doctor will have an insight.\\nFailure used to be my worst fear. This whole thing has made me question whether I am, in fact, an unintelligent country-boy who is depressed out of convenience. I logically know that's not the case. The dark spot is just looking for doubts and guilts. \\nI'm not sure what I need to do going forward at all. I have no idea where I am at in life. I have no idea how I am going to financially make it (thankfully rent is paid through August). Energetic me wants to completely reinvent myself and everything around me, fuck the cost. Depressed me can't be bothered to care. It's like I'm walking into fire intentionally. I just don't care.. At all. About anything, myself included. It's not even an evident sadness at this point. I just don't care about the consequences of everything to the point I'm willing to just sabotage everything, I think. \\nIt's really hard to explain, and school is really only an example, and there are a lot of details being left by the wayside, of course. \\nI'm not really sure what I'm asking of you, fellow redditors. This is somewhat a vent, and somewhat an open-ended question. What do you think, I guess?\\nSorry about the length.

After a mere few weeks, my back decided to give in, I was sent to the military hospital for some checks and there it was: medical discharge (they automatically give you one if you injure yourself seriously whilst still in basic training).

I’m in that “I wanna be dead but I’m too scared of dying” kinda place. I’m sure most of you know exactly what that feels like. After my back recovered I started powerlifting, I fell in love with the sport. Turns out it’s finally something I have decent talent in. It’s the one thing that keeps me alive. I’m still looking for a new job, so my days basically completely revolve around the sport. Now that goddamned virus has closed every gym.

I’ve been grinding 6 days a week for months to get at the level I’m at and the goal was to qualify for the European Championship next year.

It is a note I wrote today during fighting some inner demons. This may not be depression, it may be a mild life fog, but I am no doctor to say. Constructive feedback and not are welcome. Thanks for passing by.\\nI think I am going through some depression. I will clarify. I am healthy, in my 30s, within the norm, I have a well paid job, a mostly healthy family, good childhood, some friends here and there. I am not busy, or burned out, I do what I need to do and I end up with free time in my hands too. Why do you even complain? Would say the practical brain. There is no complaint in stating the state of your mind. It is a fact, it may change depending on daytime or weather, but it is still the current reality. The point of me diagnosing myself with depression is to face the problem.\\nI wake up, bit in a rush, head to work, and start my day looking at the faces of other people, in a struggle, hopefully questioning themselves why are they in that metro at that time, going to a place they don't necessarily like. I project these thoughts from my head to theirs. We are a silent and separated unity. I end up looking like them, I feel part of them, but I have no way to get in touch with them and empathize. No way to share the communal pain.\\nI spend the rest of the day in an office, doing what I need, even having just a bit of fun sometimes, solving problems, fixing things. No stress. Also, no real connection with people, everyone is there because they have to, not by real choice. Discussions are superficial and filtered, it is still work, we need to keep a good image and a good face. People are not struggling together, they are struggling individually.\\nThe work day finished, and I am head quickly out, maybe I manage to see a nice sky, that improves morale, but soon it is metro time. Same faces, same questions.\\nBack home I cook something simple, say hi to my really nice flatmate, we both are quiet people. It is dark outside, and I should make a decision: social or home. The social decision is hard, meaning going out again, facing another trip or two, having to drink something, having to find an interesting conversation or activity. Better not, I will stay home. Questions that I left early in the morning, re-emerge quickly. Some music and videos will keep them silent. Till it's bedtime.\\nIt is dark and quiet, I may have done some sport during the day, I may be tired physically, my brain is awake. It is just a matter of getting lost in my internal discussion, hoping that the mammal physiological behavior will make these thoughts into a dream soon. It will be easier to digest. Maybe it will take some time.\\nIt's Friday. I am done with work, I will have many hours free before any real duty will come up to me. Social actions are again needed. I am not feeling ready, I don't feel the drive, the reasons, the pleasure to meet. I feel I try to force myself into it. I should go out. I should meet some people. Maybe some new inputs, some new character will enter my life, things may change without me realizing it.\\nSaturday evening, I am still in bed from the day before, I did not move much, I cleaned a bit. I cooked for myself, simpler, faster. I got some invitations to pubs, music, houses. I kindly refuse. I am not ready, I don't find the drive, the motivation. My stream of thoughts is still there, perpetual. It is almost like a song, words repeat, first verse, second verse, chorus. I know them well, I can sing along.\\nAll this would be solved. If only. I could be in a better state. I could feel part of a group. I could have one or two close friends, physically and mentally, to whom to speak. I would feel they understand me. I would help them too, I would feel part of a collective of minds. I could have a partner. I could have a partner next to me. With similar questions, to go through together. Embracing the problems, being open, no filters needed. But this did not happen in the past and is not happening still. Where are you? Where is the part of me outside of me that still I did not meet. Is there any?\\nYears are passing by. I may be on the late train, closing time. I may have missed it already, I may be missing it in 5-10 years or so. The state of mind certainly reduces the possibilities of catching the ride. We are social animals, we search for a clan, a family circle. If we find it and accept it, we are well off. If we don’t, are there still going to be people around us like us? We may be all too far from each other to see each other In the real world. Near physically.\\nI think I am depressed. Something is unresolved in my psychology. I can and did turn it off in the past, and still do. It always re-emerge. I left partners because they were not what I was looking for. Because I was focusing on my issues, my battles, they were not part of it. I left places, lost connections with nice people. I went on, as I am meant to. Now I am still here. I think I am depressed. I think many people are around me.

I stayed with him for three years, through severe financial, sexual, mental, and physical abuse. He just absolutely destroyed my ability to trust, my sense of safety, and devastated my relationships with my friends and family by isolating me and disrespecting them. When I left in 2016, I petitioned for and was granted a protective order for the maximum term allowed by law - 3 years. I\\'ve had vivid night terrors since I left that typically involve my abuser getting into my home, or slaughtering someone I love. I started seeing a therapist and was diagnosed with C-PTSD, MDD, and Panic Disorder. \\nIn end of 2017, I began dating a guy we\\'ll call Sam. Sam seemed super kind, caring, just an overall great person. We\\'d known each other since 2011, but our relationship still felt new and exciting!  \\nUnfortunately, I found out in October that Sam had cheated on me several times over the \\\\~2 years we\\'d dated by then. He slept with someone else several times, had nudes of another woman, and emotionally cheated with a third that we\\'ll call Sarah. \\nSam would text Sarah every day all day. He\\'d ask her to dinner, take her to coffee, he took her to a wedding. Drove her everywhere. Introduced her to his son, even. Constantly complimented her body, and would refer to her as \"Pretty girl\" every day. I was upset about the woman he\\'d slept with, but his relationship with Sarah was devastating. \\nHe promised not to see her or talk to her anymore, but I found out through mutual friends that they were still hanging out. She and I ended up in a confrontation over text, in which she said very hateful things about my relationship, which felt like she\\'d heard from Sam. She continually messaged me dogging on me and my relationship until I blocked her shortly after xmas. Things were okay for a few weeks.\\nFast forward to end of January. One of my very close friends committed suicide. This was overwhelming, especially because he\\'d reached out to me two days before it happened, and I told him I was too depressed to really talk. \\nWhen I went home for the funeral, I stayed with Sam. He received emails from Sarah that someone was harassing her online, and she believed it was me. It culminated on the day of my friend\\'s funeral that Sarah showed up to Sam\\'s with her father (no we are not teenagers, she is 35 and lives with her parents). She demanded that I speak to her, yelled at me, called me obscene names, and begged me to \"hit her so she could have my ass thrown in jail\". I was already drunk on two bottles of wine, and in NO state to handle anything, so I just kept repeating that she needed to leave and I had no interest in talking to her. \\nSam took her side and told her she didnt have to leave. She then asked me if \"we we\\'re even dating.\" When i said we had been for two years, she freaked out on Sam. Apparently, he\\'d told her that I was a stalker, he didnt really know me, and I was only at his house because he was afraid Id kill myself. She left after blowing up on him, and he just went back to working on his computer in the next room. Part of me feels like HE is the one that messaged her online and created the entire blowup. \\nI was absolutely devastated. My friend\\'s suicide, my relationship with Sam, Sarah\\'s outbursts. It was too much. I took a box cutter off the shelf and sliced open my arm, then downed the rest of my citalopram. (6 pills of 40 MG)\\nSince that night, I\\'ve (halfway) broken things off with Sam. Even though we still talk and hang out and everything. i feel like im just stuck in another cycle and im ashamed and just feel pathetic for allowing him to stick around.

(21 F) : I wrote this earlier today. Maybe you can relate. Please take the time to read it... \\nMost days I feel nothing at all. I can’t cry, I don’t laugh, I’m just numb.  Then there are days like this where I feel everything at once, yet I still feel silenced by it all. The feeling of being suffocated by deep sadness. It’s as though everything has no purpose and I can’t find myself to accomplish anything. You know deep down you mean so much to so many people but it’s clouded by the thoughts. Nothing seems logical. It’s days like these where I feel restrained by my own self and yet again I let another day go to waste. I don’t eat, I didn’t shower or brush my teeth, my hair is in the same bun I put it in before I went to sleep last night. There is nothing worse in this world than being stuck in your own head. You’re told it can go away but it hasn’t. It’s a constant battle within yourself. After you get over the mountain of depression, you hate yourself even more for not being able to control it sooner. You don’t know how to ask for help because no one really understands how you feel. So you suffer in silence over and over again. This is my problem that I should be able to take control of, but I can’t and I haven’t so I continue to live through it time after time. You stop answering texts and calls, you cancel plans and no one knows it’s because of how depressed you are. You come up with excuse after excuse on why you can’t make it. I know I need help but what is a therapist going to say differently this time? The thought of driving over to talk and feel the exact same leaves me even more hopeless. Calling the doctor to change my medication because it’s not working is a big task that I don’t want to go through - driving to her, trying a new medication, experiencing new side effects, spending more money that I don’t have because I call out of work so often since I can’t get out of bed. I feel defeated and mentally exhausted. Some nights I’m awake, tossing and turning, hoping I’ll be able to put my mind at ease but I end up suffering from insomnia. When I finally do sleep, I wake up late and am disappointed with myself for sleeping and wasting half my day that could have been used to pick up the slack from the previous days when I was paralyzed from depression. Other nights I sleep 12+ hours. It’s like I can’t win. How are you supposed to feel when depression is taking over your life? You’re close to losing your job, your grades are terrible, you physically don’t take care of yourself anymore. Not to mention all the things you used to love to do, you can’t find the energy or passion anymore. This is when you start to fantasize about death. It just seems so promising. No more suffering. You can finally escape the constant sadness. Is there really a better answer? Will I ever understand what true happiness feels like? People tell you there is hell out there but it’s only temporary. The vicious cycle seems to pick right back up, especially when you least expect it. Doesn’t matter where you are, all you want to do is go right back in your bed, alone, away from everyone and everything - isolated one your own sadness. As I write this, I realize I need help and I want help but I’ve done it all before yet I’m still here, worse than I was before.

I also have intestine problems so basically when I’m in school, I’m often scared to crap my pants... Speaking of school, I hate each and every single one of my schoolmates there. They’re dumb, sexist, homophobic, racist, disrespectful etc. I think they are suspecting I’m gay, so they’re starting to provoke me which gives me anxiety. While we are here, I’m gay, and I’m closeted. That’s also something I hate, I can’t be myself because I’m too scared that someone could find out. That fear causes me to not have any clothes I like just because the style I like may be considered \"homo\" by everyone else. For this reason, I’m also scared to have piercing, to dye my hair or to wear some make up, which I really want to do. All that said, I hate that I’m jealous over people on Instagram. I know that it’s not real life, but I can’t help it. They are way more beautiful than me. Their hair, eyebrows, eyes, noses, lips, skins, face shape, clavicles, torsos, legs are just looking way better than mine.

I vaped/smoked heavily and quit December 16th cold turkey as I knew it wasn’t good for my anxiety in the long run. Anyways, I constantly worry about minuscule things, but it finally caught up with me when I started dating my new girlfriend and got severe performance anxiety. I was so anxious I couldn’t get in the mood, and it made things really tough. I was really down on myself for a while, and finally decided to see my doctor (around New Years) and talk about it. He recommend Paxil (10mg which would eventually go to 20mg) and also gave me viagra (keep in mind I’m 21 M, so this is very unlikely needed). I was anxious from the start of taking Paxil because I read about the increased risk of sexual side effects with it. Although it did help with my anxiety, I completely lost all interest in sex. I messaged my doctor and was telling him about the symptoms, but he ignored email, after email. I began to feel hopeless, worthless, and thought about not being here a lot. 2 weeks ago I decided to try a new doctor on my college campus (UNH). When seeing him, he was very helpful. Since then I’ve started counseling/therapy for managing my anxiety, which has been very helpful, and even managed to ween off Paxil.

After lots of surveys, blood tests to rule out other possibilities, and long emotional conversations with my new doctor, he determined I was moderately to severely depressed (not surprising as I’m a junior in a mechanical engineering curriculum). I have to wait another week to start Effexor as I was still weening if Paxil this week, but am excited. I’ve heard lots of good things about Effexor. I’d really like to not feel so stuck anymore. To enjoy being out with friends again, have the motivation to work hard again, and maybe to feel passionate about my relationship again.

I haven’t left my house and months and I feel like I am just dead. But tonight something happened. I am usually up every night do to insomnia. So I was staring at things in my room and saw my makeup and thought I would play with it. I haven’t done anything like this in forever. I was randomly playing with eyeshadow when I thought of doing a full face of makeup. So I did and then I thought I would put On an outfit for fun. I put one on which  I haven’t done in months. I live in the same two outfits. So here is the interesting part.... keep in mind months ago I tried getting all dressed up to see how I would feel and it lead to hours of crying. But this time I looked in the mirror and I saw myself. I was surprised I haven’t felt like I’m myself for awhile. I felt absolutely beautiful. Then it hit me I’m alive, I’m not dead I am a living person. And the past me before all the depression and anxiety hit, wouldn’t want me to die. I can’t slowly kill myself. Because I am alive. I started to cry happy tears and stared at myself. It was the same me I saw before I gave up. I didn’t think I would ever see this me agian. It was a bit trippy be a i didn’t feel like I was even looking at myself just a beautiful stranger in away... yet it was me. Of course I only wore the outfit and makeup for 15 minutes then took a shower. Other wise I would of had an anxiety attack. But the point is I got up only if it was just for a second. And I think that you should try this. It may take a couple try’s where you have a breakdown. But it could lead to you felling like you agian. I also want you to know that even if it’s deep deep down there is a small piece of you or your past self that wants you to be alive. Because slowly killing yourself is only going to make you feel worse. And ending it won’t allow that piece of you to grow until your able to get back up.

That is until the next time something mildly inconvenient happens (no scratch that – something mildly inconvenient happens to someone else in the family). That person’s suffering is only exacerbated when the person suffering now not only do, they have to deal with the issue, but they also have to deal with the entirely separate issue of all that negative energy that my mom creates. She then of course inevitably becomes the center of attention in regard to that initial issue, as well. \\nI should add that all those ugly reactions can also be manifested if it’s her own problems she’s dealing with.

Last year she started getting more help with this and seeing a therapist and psychiatrist. They started her on some medication which has helped... But she really started spiraling late last year. She went from working a full time job, progressing in her career, and being involved with our family and dogs, to drinking heavily, which led to becoming alcoholic, and now she's on FMLA to get it all under control. The alcohol part has gotten better, but between doing treatment at a facility and attending AA plus her medication, she's completely wiped of energy every day. I am trying to help and be supportive, but I'm also holding down my own work and all the financed to keep us going so I'm pretty wiped too. A lot of her identity was tied to her job, so it's really a struggle for her without it, but there's no way she could go back right now and do anything with these energy levels. FMLA will run out soon, and I doubt she'll be in any state to go back by then, but I don't know what else to do. We've talked about her just quiting, but it's a great job otherwise with great benefits and pay, and again it's really tied to her identity. I think the freedom from not working would be great until she's got a better handle on the depression and anxiety, but how of I even start to say that? I'm really worried she'd just spiral.worse without something to do or some other purpose. We've tried exercise, getting outdoors, games, crafts, and other stuff to find hobbies that might call to her, but nothing really fills that job-shaped void so far. We're only 28. We have vacations and events planned months out, but I can't see us doing any of them. We've only told her side of the family. They're supportive and try to help, but they live on the east coast and we're on the west so there's only so much they can do. No one on my side of the family or any of our friends know really. I feel guilty wanting to tell folks to explain why I'm flaking out on them or not participating, but I have this whole other thing going on in secret, and her needs come before them. I have zero experience with any of this. I keep hoping there will be some guidance counselor or advisor to come in and explain what the actual real difference is between leave vs disability, and who else we should be seeing or talking to, and what a realistic time table is for any of this, and in general how to get my wife back. Maybe she'll never be back to 100%, but I still love her, and it's tearing me apart not knowing how to help her. AA folks say the family has to be able to go on in their own life and not be dragged down by the person's addiction, but with depression and anxiety, I'm scared to death of what would happen if I'm not there supporting her every day. None of this is her fault. She's trying really hard every single day. We're both very detailed people who like to plan ahead, so the ambiguity of it all is driving us nuts. Like some days we might go to the mall, do a workout, play with the dogs, and make dinner together like nothing ever happened. Some days we may not leave the bed and just watch Gilmore Girls while eating only peta bread. There's no rhyme or reason.

God, The Universe or whatever all mighty being that controls us however, had other plans for me. My life seemed to fall apart piece by piece in front of me.\\nThis may seem crazy to some but it was the beginning of my devastation. My HS releases the top 10% of the graduating class every year (by GPA) and posted the order and the students' pictures in front of the auditorium. I am a quiet and shy person and I felt this was my chance to prove myself and it was something I strove hard for. When the results came out, I realized I had missed the cut. After speaking to my friends and comparing the GPA's of the students on the list, I realized I missed it by 0.005 points.\\nAt the time, my sister (20) was at odds with me and my family over a myriad of issues including her arrogant asshole boyfriend who she refused to leave no matter how many times she was manipulated by him. I was extremely close to my sister throughout our childhood, but she, along with her boyfriend repeatedly disrespected and took advantage of my parents and I. Facing all of this family conflict I sat there powerless. My words mean't nothing to my parents or my sister and despite the fact that my sister ended up getting kicked out of the house after an argument, my parents continued to pay for her $45k tuition. I loved my sister and when I contacted her truly offering my best advice, she wouldn't hear anyof it. She threatened to cut me out of her life for good.\\nI was distraught, and due to this and the accumulation of the depression over the years of stress, I finally broke. I ended up missing missing over a quarter of the school year (mostly consecutively) while I was enrolled in mostly AP level classes including Physics C (E&amp;M in one year), Calc BC (including AB content), and US Gov/Pol. During my time away from school I began self harm, thoughts of suicide grew, We searched desperately for help, and I had to convince a Doctor to not have me put in an adolescent psychiatric ward as I sat on his patient table (I have nothing against good psychiatric wards, I just knew it wasn't the right choice for me). Eventually I found my match a pnp saved my life, medicated me correctly and I was on my way to recovery.\\nHowever, now I was faced with the challenge of catching up on 3 intense AP classes while remaining stable. My teachers all advised me to drop my classes, but I refused. on my transition back I worked the hardest I had ever worked before. I was allowed 2 weeks of half days to help myself acclimate, and everyday those two weeks I came home and watched my teachers math videos from 12 pm to 7 pm on double speed. I followed all the class notes, and did all the homework. I was able to catch myself up completely (except for tests taken) to the rest of the class within those 2 weeks. I ended that year with 5s on all my APs except History.\\nThis was the biggest accomplishment of my life and I was extremely proud and while I missed a few college application during my time out of school I was accepted into an Engineering program at a School ranked in the top #15 for Engineering in the U.S. that year.  \\nI wanted to share this to show you guys since many like myself think its the end when something like this happens, but you can persevere with the right help and determination.   \\nDon't read more if u want a story to have a good ending :/\\nI wish I could tell you I stayed in a good state of mind after all that but sadly I've fallen in darker times than I have ever experienced. I rarely leave the house, and I wake up every morning depressed with a lack of will to live. I chose to take a semester off from college after I came close to killing myself and moved back home with my family. Things have been extremely rough and I'm starting to feel like the people I used to be able to count on are no longer there for me. I feel lost and the prospect of suicide seems more and more inviting as the days pass. I have other University prospects and am on a search for a part time job but my motivation falls everyday and my will to carry on has fallen to an all time low. I can no longer even describe how horrible I feel, and realistically the only thing that has stopped me from ending it all is my friends and family and I can bare the thought of how it would affect them. I have resorted to heavy use of marijuana and abusing the increasingly higher dose of drugs I'm being given for my symptoms. I've blacked out from these drugs once so far and truly believe I could have died from the combination I took (obv this was not the recommended usage of the drugs).\\nI feel like I'm at the end of the road and if things dont get better soon I may have to find my own way out.  \\nI wouldn't wish this upon anyone and truely hope all of you guys suffering from mental illness your best life possible  \\nThanks for letting me rant... needed an outlet.

I’ve posted here once today already, but I deleted is as I needed to rethink what I’ve written. Here’s the new version. (Sorry for my English – not native speaker).\\nI can’t stop thinking about the bad things I’ve done in the past. What it includes is mostly internet scams. I was teenager then (it started at age 12) and I’ve scammed multiple people for \\\\~5 dollars in average. Sometimes it was less, sometimes it was more.\\nIt seems like it’s not a big amount but – for me it is. After every of these scams I felt “I need to give it back”, so I did. Where it was possible, after some time I decided to give it back and say sorry, but it was not always possible – that’s what hurts me. The biggest “scam” was  a video game skin, for like 70 dollars. I gave back as much as I could then, but never could say sorry. I think I might be able to do this in the future – then I will do it. I think I did it because I got scammed few time myself as a kid too, so it was some kind of “revenge” maybe.\\nFor the “source” of this problem I can see an internet forum (as for now? who knows what my mind will suggest me later.) where I registered as a teenager. I scammed someone for like 2 dollars here and let’s say the forum account is in some way linked to my real identity – and I can’t delete it as it is banned. I tried talking to the administrator but no way. As I know how to search for it, my mind goes there very often. I wish it could get deleted, but it won’t.\\nThe forum account also has some low quality posts, as I was a teenager then and I didn’t think about it.\\nI think I am in some way scared, paranoid that someone can “dox” me in the future and find these posts. They do not include anything really, really bad, and no real evidence of the scam itself there. I am just being paranoid. I don’t know how to stop it. Maybe I am scared about someone “doxing” my past too?\\nAlso, there’s a thing in “me”, that tells me to say about everything I’ve done bad in the past to my parents. I told them about some of the bad things, but I also want to keep some secrets. I don’t want to make them sad or be angry at me. I think it happens because they always considered me a good person, and they don’t know about the bad things I’ve done. It looks like I am trying to change their mind in some way, by telling them these things, but that’s not my intention. I am a good person and I know it. I didn’t scam anyone for a few years now and I consider myself as a good person. I wouldn’t scam anyone ever again, even if someone would give me access to his bank account or something where I could take his money anonymously – I wouldn’t. I am serious about it.

I work probably 50 hours a week and I even started college so that I could get a better job. I currently make $42k a year, which seems like good money, but not for 3 people to live off of. I give them both what ever they want, when ever they want it. My wife has a far better vehicle than me, brand new iPhone 11, I always get her jewelry and makeup, and let her get pretty much what ever she wants. I do t have much myself, but I don’t really care.

I dropped out of college because I thought that was stressing her out. Still miserable. I’m f***ing exhausted and depressed as crap and there’s NOTHING I can do to make our lives better.

I hope its not an issue, but I'll need to give some backstory, so here goes. \\nI've been overweight nearly my entire life. I found it harder and harder to control my eating as I got older (and got my hands on money for fast food), and even as a child I can remember fighting with my parents because they wanted me to eat the child portions at restaurants. Ten years and hundreds of diets down the line, I have completely lost control of my eating to a level that I'm spending hundreds of pounds a month on fast food. Even over the last three days, I've eaten two or three sandwiches at lunch each day, chocolate, crisps etc etc. I've had two massive dominoes, McDonald's and KFC, each time to a point where I'm so full I feel ill and tonight made myself throw up a £45 dominoes order worth of pizzas, chicken and cookies. I've tried what feels like hundreds of times to lose weight, and lost nearly 90 pounds in the summer, was really beginning to feel as though I was doing something meaningful and that I was going to escape the pain of being obese, before a friend (who I will talk about later) cut me off and my eating and exercise just collapsed. This collapse in my healthy mindset caused me to flunk my A-Levels, and lost a place at a top 10 university in the world for History, going from motivated to barely even wanting to go to university. The same goes for my drinking, where I often have been so drunk at parties that I've passed out and broken people's stuff, at one point I think I slapped someones butt and basically shamelessly hit on them in front of people and still feel awful for doing something that I thought I could never bring myself to do, realising in retrospect I drink to change how people perceive me, from an introvert to this outgoing, funny guy who loves to party. I'm not a regular drinker, but when I drink, I drink; to a level that I am throwing up everywhere in my own home as I'm drinking a whole bottle of vodka on my own. \\nI've been romantically fucked my whole teenage life. I'm 19, gay and the only action I think I ever had was with a guy who did it to steal weed out of my  back pocket while we were kissing, and have aspects to my sexuality that honestly make me want to kill myself. Due to my sexuality and my weight I learnt to hate myself, and became so depressed that in February of 2018 I tried to hang myself with a belt, but the hanger I was using snapped due to my weight, so ironically i owe my life to my obesity. When I opened up to friends, many of them fell away from me, distancing themselves from the crazy kid. I ended up forming unhealthy relationships with some of the only people that stayed with me through my struggles, which caused them to fall away from me. Most notably, I fell in love with a boy in my year at boarding school extremely heavily due to the fact that I perceived him as my saviour (as on many occasions he wouldn't leave me alone because he knew I was ready to kill myself at the time). Losing that friend was the catalyst to allowing my diet to fall apart, and whilst I wish him the best in life, I can't help but feel that if he'd just held on a few more months, I could be healthy and happy now. Now I'm working a job I hate in a country I desperately want to leave.\\nI'm anxious, I'm afraid of my own mind and feel like I won't ever be able to lose weight. I just wish I didn't exist anymore to be honest, and the things I felt so passionate about, mainly shooting (I shot for England as a teen), and aviation, have all slid away and I feel alone and lost without anybody to truly talk to.

I\\'m living in a small backwater settlement with not much more than 4000 inhabitants; a kinda old-school place, where the middle-aged and older know each other pretty well, but the younger act like they were from the big cities.\\nI never really felt like fitting in, but for majority of my lifetime I didn\\'t paid attention to it, as it never really bothered me until recently.\\nApart from a few occasional trips I never left my hometown. I was raised here. My family lived in a house with a nice big garden. Five of us. My maternal grandparents, my father, my mother and I, the only child. After being at age I was sent to preschool, but my parents took me out after less then a year, because I was always getting sick (minor colds, nothing serious, for somehow I always ended up beind sat right next to the window), and i was kept at home \\'till elementary school. In school I was concidered a good (even exemplary, as they claimed) student and child. During my school years I always had exactly two close friends, everybody else was just an acquaintance, even in my own class. Until fourth or fifth grade there wasn\\'t really any \"problems\" with me socially, but as puberty started to kick in amoung us, I slowly started to became the odd one. I always had long hair, and that alone was enough for the others to pick on me. Mix it with me being the \"nerd\" who always got good grades, was taken to competitions after competitions in natural science and literature subjects, hated popular music, listened to rock/metal, never went to parties or clubbing, didn\\'t smoke, didn\\'t got drunk with the others, never liked dancing or any sports. Also as puberty progressed started to I started to gain some weight. Nothing to sugarcoat (because I would eat that too) I was quite chubby. Not obese, but I had my handles.\\nAfter finishing the elementary school, I attented to the local high school, (which is located literally next door to my elementary), with 85% of my old class, so we basically brought the social structures with us. Before that, we got distant and separated with one of my close friend up to the point that we didn\\'t even spoke to each other for 16 years now. He got buddies with the rich kid of the class, they went to a different school, started clubbing, getting girlfriends, so he lived his normal life, in which there is no place for a nerd like me.\\nDuring the 4 years of high school my non-existent social circle shrunk even more. I replaced my old friend with a new one, so there was three of us again, but apart from occasionally hanging out with them I started to keeping to myself more and more. The others were busy dating and partying, while my attention turned towards reading, paying attention to anything that was in english and playing computer games. I was still in the top of my class when it came to the grades, but I had to put literally zero effort in it. I\\'ve just read the given texts of the lessons once or twice, (even though I\\'m a very slow reader), said a few sentences when I was asked and it was enough for acing the four years. You can imagine what it did to my attention span, and willingness to put effort into anything.\\nDuring the twelve years I tried to court two girls, but was rejected by both of them. When I told my mother about my first attempt at asking a girl out (one of my classmate in sixth grade) her reaction was very disapproving, along the lines of \"You shouldn\"t do that!\" which I think also added an extra weight to my baggage. After that, for a very long time I didn\\'t even try to do any advance on any woman.\\nI finished high school with an A+ degree in all subject (they even had mercy on me in sports). I took a succesful language exam in english far more earlier then the rest of the class, without attending to the extra and summer lessons.\\nOf course, as \"bright child\" (buy only in a local sense as it turned out) I attended to a university right away. But... I didn\\'t really gave it a thought. My family was not too wealthy, and I didn\\'t wanted to overwhelm them financially. I was always said that I think maturely, more mature than my age, so that also reinforced my decision of attending to the nearest, cheapest possible university, from where I can get home in an hour so my parents don\\'t have to pay for dorm and such. I literally just take the option of least resistance instead of taking a look into what I\\'m good at or what interests me. Now looking back this is one decision I regret.\\nMaking friends was never my strong suit, and it didn\\'t change during the university. But some of the teachers instantly liked me. I also gain entry to an ornithology group and was listed in the crew of the next offical, certified experiment run by my professor in my very first year.\\nThen life decided to take a turn towards the more darker areas. After being done with my first year, during summer break, my mother get ill, almost died and spent 52 days in hospital, mostly in intensive care. I went to visit her every single day. Then it turned out that the complications and treatments given to her in attempt to save her life ruined her kidneys. From that moment we started a 6 years long struggle with all the few ups and the many downs. With dialysis, my mother temporarly got better for a while, but after a some time she just gave up on life, refused to attend to dialysis and in the end, let herself pass in excrutiating pain. We tried everything from being kind to being authoritive but nothing worked. The last line I heard from her was \"Go away! Go home! Leave me alone!\" as a reaction to my desperate attempt to get her to change her mind.\\nThe next day she passed away when I was on my way to the hospital.\\nDuring this period my grandfather was also getting more and more sick, with more and more severe complications from diabetes and aging. Under half a year I lost both my mother and my grandfather.\\nMy grandmother was and is totally devastated by the events, yet, God bless her, she is still kicking and active, but the age and sorrow is slowly gaining on her. She often claimes that I\\'m the only reason she\\'s still alive. My father become more closed and keeping to himself, however, lately he tries to be more open.\\nOn my life the toll was huge as well. I dropped out of the university and stayed at home to help if needed. But in the peaceful days when everything was calm, and my help wasn\\'t needed I started to seperate myself from the world more and more. With no friends, no money and no opportunities to blow off some steam, my only entertainment and escape were the books, movies and pirated video games.\\nLater when money was thight I started to work at the local school as an administrator. I kept working there past the death of my mother and grandfather. Though it was offically a standard 9-5 job, my boss had her own civil organisation too, with which I was \"supposed\" to help, so I worked overtime and often during the night too. That once more locked me up in my office and my hometown for good. Apart from the occasional movie nights at the theatre in the nearest city I never really had a night off. The paycheck was enough to cover the bills and a few insurance but not much more. Travelling wasn\\'t an option, because I didn\\'t have money, and I didn\\'t (and still do not) have a driver\\'s licence. The overwork and working behind the desk took its toll on my physique too: I\\'m tall-ish, 185 cm, but also 130 kg, and I\\'m out of breath very easily if I have to maintan constant physical effort. The only thing I can do in a prolonged fashion is walking at a 2-3 km/h speed for hours, but I breaking out in sweat very, and I mean very easily (in the first 3 minutes), and my body is covered with soft fat tissue with no hardness of any muscle. These things hintered my confidence when it came down to approaching women as well. I tried to hit it off with two of my colleagues after a 15 years pause, but, again both of them rejected me. So I never really tried any harder than that after the repeated failures.\\nI even gave up on making friends.The few people I know and hang out with are from my workplace. And even towards them I am more and more suspicious, especially since I (think) I learned to read body language and notice all the small details of aversion on them. As far as I can tell my relationship with them is contrversial at best, because if I organise something, they agree to tag along, but I rarely got invited by them.\\nThe one thing that didn\\'t change is that once again, I consider exactly two of them my close friend. A handsome young male dance teacher and a beatuiful young musician woman. We often hang out at my place, which I rent out to dance teacher (for dirt cheap, as I live in our family house with my grandmother and father) talking, getting drunk, playing some games and stuff. Sometimes they say that they like me, and they never ask me to leave, even if I tell them that they are free to do so, because I know that I\\'m difficult person to bear. But I just can\\'t shake the thought of they being on \"good terms\" with me because that\\'s how they \"repay\" me for I rent the place to the man for cheap and because I actively seek to help woman emotionally, beacuse she is a fragile soul (there was a few occasions when I spent a good portion of the night with her either in person or on the phone because she \"needed someone to talk\" to and reached out for me). This woman is also very attractive and kind, as they say a \"dame to kill for\", but I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m not her type and suspect that she and the dance teacher are attracted to each other, and are sleeping together, so no room for me in her life. They say that there is nothing between them apart from our friendship, but I know that to man made several attempts at seducing her, and as far as I can tell after half a bottle of hard liquor they playing the flirting game quite good. And that\\'s just the things I see when I\\'m with them. That\\'s why I constatly hint them that they can tell me to get lost if the had enough of my company).\\nApart from the above as today, I still don\\'t have a university degree, no driver\\'s licence, and I recently left my job as well, becauce there was a change in the person of the director, and the new boss couldn\\'t really support neither herself nor me against the attacks from a few co-workers and the members of the directional group originating nothing more but personal disdain. Luckily I had a few month worth of expanses saved up in cash, but now my money run out and I live off a loan and the rent the teacher pays me.\\nI\\'m not without a job entirely, though, as a \"leading\" agent of an insurance company, who made a life insurance for my grandmother, took an interest in me (I was present, actively interfering with the processs when they signed the papers in order to keep my grandmother from accepting a disadvantegous offer), and she introduced me into a program for new agents with education, professional support and such. Because of this, I started to take driving lessons too, but I struggle with it. I also feel unsure about this job opportunity as an insurance agent, as it is a quite controversial trade; but everybody, who has authority in the program, even the regional director wants me to stay, even though I tried my best to scare them off.\\nSo for now I still stick to it, because I think this is my only option to earn some good money as I have literally no other paper about any other, noteable qualification. The only \"certification\" I\\'m somewhat proud of is my offical MENSA membership (but I\\'m suspicious about that too, since I only passed for the second time I took the test; when they wanted to open a new local group in the county I live, so I wager they lent me a few extra points, so I pass 130 mark in order to gain more local members.)\\nI couldn\\'t stand to leave the country, because of my grandmother, who is still deathly afraid of me gettig hurt or in trouble if I don\\'t spend the night at home.\\nSo here I am, jobless, moneyless, without a car, out of oppotunities. A kissless virgin, who doesn\\'t even bother to approach woman anymore, because I can tell at least a dozen reasons right from the top of my head why they should reject me and go for someone better (what measn literally any other man than me).\\nBut the hardest part of all: I literally have absolute zero motivation or interest towards anything. I can\\'t tell why I keep waking up in the morning and do the tasks I\\'m trusted with. I think it\\'s not even depression as for most of the time I feel and think about absolutely nothing, it\\'s just static in my brain. Other times I just feel anything apart from rage, despair, incompetence, overwhelming impotence and being sick with everything. I don\\'t even feel the need to change or improve my life anymore because as I see it, it would be so much effort for literally nothing. I feel the discomfort of not having this or that but only when I witness others living their life. And sometime I can logically prove myself that I would need this and that if I try. But that\\'s it. All are fleeting all so quickly.\\nYeah, I could earn more money, but for why? My standards are pretty low: a place to sleep with a computer and internet acces, some food, and a bathroom.\\nGetting an SO? Why? And how? I mean I would like to have a family and children, of course, but first I would need to induce emotions other than disgust or disdain in a woman and keep her attention for more then two minutes. But I\\'m so incompatible with people that it does not go for me just like that, naturally. It would take an enourmous amount of effort and even if I would somehow accidentally succeed, there\\'s still a high chance that she would just leave me after I realize that I\\'m the most boring person in the world. My life is so bleak and blank that when I\\'m with my \"friends\" I keep making up stories about the adventures and exes I had when I was younger in order to I have something to talk about. And even though I try keep these stories consistent, I feel they see right through it but feel so sorry about me that they just let me keep talking.\\nHonestly, all I want to do is run away. I\\'m tired of my life, I\\'m tired of myself. I\\'m uninterested in everything. I just do things so people leave me alone about it. Because I still hear from the few of them saying \"why don\\'t you do something with that big brain of yours?\" \"Why don\\'t you get a nice lady for yourself?\"\\nBECAUSE I CAN\\'T, THAT\\'S WHY!\\nBecause there is no place for me in this entire goddamned world. Because all I get is disdain. Which is replaced by hatred if I warn others about something and it turns out that I was right. Like I\\'m not even allowed to be correct about anything. \"Smile more!\" \"Be kinder\" \"Ask about and talk with people\" they say! Of course, &gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt; should go out of my way just to get a whole lot of ignorance in return.\\nThey just keep talking, but don\\'t know, they just don\\'t understand! The suggest me to make friends... in a settlement where I\\'m the wierdo, who was accused with basically everything from being a homosexual through being a pedofil to being a drug addict?! Are they even aware what they are talking about?\\nI\\'m also tired of that few people giving me more credit than I worth. Because I literally worth nothing. That\\'s literally my life: I\\'m either prasied for something I\\'m not or I\\'m the last, forgotten piece of shit.\\nIn my younger age I was actively advocate against suicide. Now I wouldn\\'t mind if somehow all of this just would end.\\nI want people to let me go. I don\\'t want to die explicitly. I just want a place where noone knows me. Were noone expects or want anything from me. A place where I can finally make peace with the piece of deadweight I am on this world and live the rest of my miserable life in seclusion, being THAT wierdo from the third floor, who you just see the corner of you eye in the morning and in the evening.\\nI just want the world the stop remind me about what they think I should be. I know I had dreams, I know I had potential. I could have been an astronomer, a doctor, an actor, an electrician, or just a simple family man. But that\\'s the point. I COULD have been. But it\\'s over. It\\'s in the past. I can\\'t be any of those things anymore.\\nI just want people to finally agree with me that I played all my cards wrong, succesfully wasted my life, never lived up to my potential, scream and yell at me for being an utter piece of shit, then throw me away and let me wither in peace. I simply ask the world to leave me alone without giving me signs of \"Hey! Why don\\'t you do this or that?\"\\nIs that so much to ask?',\n","  'labels': ['healthy', 'severe', 'moderate'],\n","  'scores': [0.6366352438926697, 0.2035539150238037, 0.15981076657772064]},\n"," {'sequence': \"Scars and sex : Im a 22 year old dude that still self harms frequently but only ever in the exact same spot on my one thigh compleatly invisible when wearing boxers or swim trunks (obviously so no one will ever see them).

And then out of no where the unthinkable happend... she suggested we go skiing together and shed teach me how to ski!!! You know that feeling of happiness I said I felt before well that felt like chicken shit compared to what I experienced in that moment. That truly was the happiest moment of my life and I was so filled with hope for what could be my future, not explicitly one with her but one that had friends. I replied instantly and tried to organize something............ and I've been ghosted for 2 days. I refuse to double text or call her. no person whod actually be intrested wouldn't remember to message back.

Says he sees lots of people with it and he\\'s ex military so he knows (but I\\'ve never been seen by you before???)\\nThen he says he\\'s not really into medication (????) Says he believes in holistic approaches like herbs, acupuncture and the whatnot w a combination of therapy. Says he will refer me to therapist intake. I was clear that I wanted to go the medication route and wasn\\'t interested in \"herbs\". He says well if you\\'re sure we can do a swab test and maybe start you on a small dose of zoloft but other things would be better. I said I\\'d take the swab. So he says sure, but I\\'ll also put you down for therapist intake (???)\\nSo I leave and he gives his instructions to the nurse. Once he\\'s gone I tell her 1) Under no circumstances do I want to be seen by him again 2) I said I didn\\'t want a therapist intake there and 3) Just please give me a prescription so I can go. So she says sure...then sends my prescription to a walgreens to be filled. I leave...head to the Walgreens...and the pharmacist goes...Didnt they tell you? We dont accept your insurance. You have to have this filled with your original provider. \\n...No, no one told me that. It\\'s after 5pm. I call them and they are closed. He says you can still pick this up, but you have to pay out of pocket. I call my original provider and they\\'re like, well yeah obviously we have to write your prescription and fill it (then what was I referred for???????). I asked if they knew the \"doctor\" they had me see was selling herbalife and snake oil on the side. They said they go through a third-party for referrals, there\\'s a lot of doctors in the system. \\nAt this point I\\'m standing in the middle of a Walgreens near tears. Not depression tears mind you, rage tears. I just paid for it out of pocket because I wanted to go home. Oh and by the way my insurance won\\'t reimburse me. Because according to them someone should\\'ve known where to send the Rx. So fuck me I guess.  But I can\\'t take it because I\\'m definitely not going back to that place to have it refilled and I need SOMEONE to tell me why I can\\'t just been seen by my original provider. This has been such bullshit. I feel like I would\\'ve just been better off coming home from work and going to sleep like I always do.\\nLike what is the point of making this shit as hard as fucking possible???

Nothing is even worth it anymore. Why did I have to be born on this planet? I am too tired to deal with this at this point. I was basically crying myself to sleep last night. \\nSo yesterday I was with my homies in class and one thing led to another and we started talking about why I didn’t have a girlfriend and shit like that, and it later dawned on me. I never had a girl or anything like that. For starters, I’m 16. Almost everyone I know is already in a relationship, some get in many. I could just walk down the halls and see a whole bunch of people making out and shit, which it’s a high school, you’re gonna see shit like that every day. But it immediately gets me wondering; why can’t I get shit like that? What is it about myself that makes no one even care about me or love me at all? How hard is it for me to get such a thing that seems so easy for others to have? Like what, do these people just go up to random people and ask them out and there we go? It can’t be that easy, but everyone else makes it look like it is.\\nI did have many opportunities, that I utterly fucked up. There have been times when I either had girls had a crush on me, which I knew of, or were friends with a girl that I could have had a chance with. One was a girl I met at a softball practice. My nieces used to play softball all the time when they were younger, and used to go to practice, and I would go as well. I met this girl who I became friends with. However, I only saw her like once or twice, and never saw her again. There was also this girl I met at my niece’s birthday party, who admitted that she liked me, by writing “I love you, Chad” with chalk in the backyard. Now, my name isn’t Chad, just putting it out there, because that would be hilarious if it was, but no, people my whole life always fuck my name up for some reason. \\nThose people I met MANY years ago, however, and I haven’t seen them since. \\nHowever, there was this one girl that I knew when I was in eighth grade, that had a crush on me, who I’m not gonna name for obvious reasons. She would flirt with me all the time, and it basically became a joke with everyone. I could tell you many stories about this, but let’s just say it’s not family-friendly. I should’ve definitely taken that opportunity, but here’s the thing; I was incredibly different back then. If you knew me now, and compared how I was back then, I was a whole different person. I was incredibly shy back then, and every time she would flirt, for example; like one time she called me daddy in front of everyone, I would always blush and get awkward. That was the difference, now, I know for certain I would have handled that differently and way better than I did back then. I regret not doing anything about that at all. In the beginning, I doesn’t really like her at all, and thought she was just annoying, but something happened. After awhile, I started getting a crush on her as well, and it went from there. It was basically a huge sexual-awakening for me, and led to my big problem which I’ll get to soon. I remember I would basically fantasize about being in a relationship with her. Now, when I look back, it’s cringy as fuck. I handled that extremely wrong. Anyways, I remember one time she was mad at me because she thought I liked a girl that I was friends with, even though we were just friends. It’s actually kind of hilarious, now that I think about it. But yeah, I basically left eighth grade and went to high school, and she went somewhere else, so there’s that one I fucked up on. \\nSo, on to high school. I have a huge problem with having a crush on, well, basically every girl I see and know. Now, I know that shit is normal, but it’s a huge problem for me. It’s almost like I just think of girls as objects and not actual people. I could just look at basically every girl and fantasize about having sex with them. It’s just annoying at this point. I have some friends that are girls as well, and every single day I see them, I just imagine having sex with them. It’s excruciatingly annoying. I could have a chance with them, but here’s the thing; it’s all just a trap. I could get attached with a girl, and what do you know? They’re either in a relationship, or are lesbian. It’s almost like there’s no chance either way for me. Almost everyone in my school is in a relationship, or just simply don’t want me. I have done this many times, I tried what I could to be in a relationship with someone, and it turns out that it’s not going to happen. I have done this all the time, and I’m basically tired of it. It’s obvious I don’t care about them as people at all, I obviously don’t think of them as something other than objects. I just want my dick wet. I just want to smash, that’s all it is. I don’t deserve any of these people. I wonder why no one even cares about me at all, but now I know.\\nIt’s all a joke, I’m just put here to be tortured. If there is a god(s), they obviously put me here as a joke, to laugh at me. It’s all obvious and adds up. They’ll do anything to make my existence terrible. I’m not meant for anything other than that. I don’t deserve this life, I just want out. I just want to feel like people actually care about me, but that way of living died with my childhood years ago. Ever since I left elementary, my life went downhill. Why can’t I go back to then?
